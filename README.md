## Hello World

Hi, my name is Ham. I like coding.

Technically Frontend Developer, but I like doing other parts of the stack just as much.

Typescript is Love, Typescript is Life.

I like making [random stuff](https://v4-ham-san-net.netlify.app/ja/projects).

//TODO: Integrate with [Hamweb](https://github.com/hamzaabamboo/ham-san.net) and [Hambot](https://github.com/hamzaabamboo/hambot)
